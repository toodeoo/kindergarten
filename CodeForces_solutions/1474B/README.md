# B. Different Divisors

time limit per test : `1 second`

memory limit per test : `256 megabytes`

input : `standard input`

output : `standard output`

Positive integer `x` is called divisor of positive integer `y`, if `y` is divisible by `x` without remainder. For example, `1` is a divisor of `7` and `3` is not divisor of `8`.

We gave you an integer `d` and asked you to find the smallest positive integer `a`, such that :

    · `a` has at least `4` divisors;
    · difference between any two divisors of a is at least `d`.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1≤d≤10000).

## Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.
